This project utilises a full-stack framework, incorporating Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My objective is to develop a responsive website that enables users to perform CRUD operations, as well as post, comment, and interact with events by liking or unliking them.

### SUPERUSER CREDENTIALS:  
- username - heroku_admin 
- password - 1a2d3m4i5n
  
These will be needed to access some features of the site.


# Overview

- The website targets vulnerable and underserved youth, offering a platform for lifelong skill development similar to Boys and Girls Scouts. My mission is to expand events into an online hub where participants earn badges by mastering skills, fostering interaction, and applying abilities to life challenges. Youth aged 6-18 can transition and grow in a safe space. 
The age limit of 18 years old aligns with the legal definition of adulthood in the USA, which is why it's applicable for the websites purposes.

- The name iCreate embodies the boundless potential within each individual child to shape their own reality, transcending limitations imposed by environment or resources. It stands as a powerful affirmation of personal empowerment, urging individuals to craft their unique selves without constraints.

- It's important to note that while this project is currently developed solely for educational purposes, it will be further developed for future use by my children and for volunteer work with youth through an established organisation.

# UX

Applying fundamental UX principles, I initially focused on devising a strategy by identifying the target audience and determining the features that would offer them the most value.


The target audience for 'iCreate Youth' includes:

- Youth aged 6-18 years old, aiming to engage them in constructive and educational activities.
- Individuals seeking to explore their creativity and develop new skills.
- Students looking for opportunities to participate in events and workshops relevant to their interests.
- Guardians interested in providing their children with enriching experiences and learning opportunities.

These users will be looking for:

- An engaging and interactive website tailored to their age group.
- Opportunities to explore various interests and hobbies through workshops and events.
- A platform where they can register for events and courses easily.
- Features to track their progress and achievements, such as earning badges or certificates.
- A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation to access content and resources.
- The ability to post, comment and like events an provide feedback reviews.
- Functionality to manage their registrations, including canceling or rescheduling participation as needed.

This website will provide all of these features while ensuring a safe and supportive online environment for youth to 
learn, explore, and grow. Additionally, it will incorporate CRUD functionality to allow administrators to manage workshops, courses, registrations, and user data effectively.

# Structure

The MVP website for youth aged 6-18 is structured to be intuitive and engaging, with clear navigation and visually appealing design elements. The platform prioritises simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that young users can easily navigate, interact with content, and participate in various activities tailored to their age group. Additionally, the website emphasises safety and accessibility, providing a secure environment for youth to explore, learn, and engage with the platform's offerings. Simplicity helps young users to quickly and easily access the app and navigate within the app.

The website comprises two applications:

- Event: The event app oversees Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, along with managing notifications, for all event-related content. Additionally, it incorporates review functionality for events and includes a feature to count likes, all with the aim of delivering a user-friendly experience tailored for young users while ensuring smooth interaction with the platform.

- About: The "about" app provides website details and empowers professional instructors/users to showcase their skills and organise events. Its objective is to promote engagement with the iCreate hub by facilitating workshops, knowledge sharing, and collaboration to nurture personal and professional growth through specialised classes and meaningful interactions. This page features a form for users to offer their workshops and events.

## Bugs and Issues
- I'm experiencing an unresolved bug related to Bootstrap slight responsiveness on a tablet.
- User image uploads weren't uploading to Cloudinary. To fix this I added {% load cloudinary %} at the top of the file
- The  button on the form was not responding
- The front flip cards were not displaying the image. To fix this I included the {% load static %} at the top of the file
- The back flip cards were not displaying the text correct. To fix this I reduced the text in admin

# Deployment

## How this site was deployed
Here are the basic steps for deploying a project from Gitpod to Heroku and linking it to GitHub using manual deployment:

## Prepare Your Project:

- Ensure your project is ready for deployment and is working as expected locally.
Make sure your project includes a requirements.txt file listing all the dependencies and a Procfile to specify the command to start the web server.

## Create a GitHub Repository:

- If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for your project.
Push your project code to this GitHub repository.

## Set Up Heroku Account:

- Sign up for a Heroku account.
Install the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine.

## Create a New App on Heroku:

- Log in to your Heroku account via the terminal using the Heroku CLI.
Create a new app on Heroku using the heroku create command.

## Link Heroku App to GitHub Repository:

- Go to the "Deploy" tab of your Heroku app dashboard.
Under "Deployment method," select GitHub as the deployment method.
Search for your GitHub repository and connect it to your Heroku app.

## Enable Manual Deployment:

- Disable automatic deploys to ensure that changes pushed to your GitHub repository do not trigger automatic deployments on Heroku.
You can do this by clicking on the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button and then turning off the "Wait for CI to pass before deploy" option.

## Deploy Your App:

- Manually deploy your app by clicking the "Deploy Branch" button in the "Manual deploy" section.
Choose the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., main or master).

## Wait for Deployment:

- Wait for the deployment to finish, and check the logs for any errors.

## Test Your Deployed App:

- Once the deployment is complete, open your app using the provided Heroku URL and test that it works as expected.
By following these steps, you can manually deploy your project from Gitpod to Heroku and link it to GitHub for version control.

- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

- Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project.

The live link can be found [https://github.com/AmandaCIdev/iCreate](#).

## How to clone the repository
1. Go to the GitHub repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there.
3. Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone.
4. On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied URL and press the Enter key to begin the clone process.

## Django and Heroku 
- I followed the Code Institute's Coding Coach instructional video to install and set up the Django framework.
